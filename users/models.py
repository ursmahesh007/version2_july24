'''
A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. 
It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. 
Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

The basics:
Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model.
Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API.
